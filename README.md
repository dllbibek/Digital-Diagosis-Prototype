# Digital-Diagosis-Prototype
Well, this program delivers the probability of disease you may be suffering from. This prototype version asks the user several symptoms to answer in 0 or 1.  Based on the answers, the program identifies the disease. Covid-19, Pneumonia, common cold, flu, and allergy are the only diseases in this prototype program.   Instead of using if-else statements that will show certain diseases only if the exact input is met, this program uses  RESIDUAL SUM OF SQUARES (RSS), a mathematical-statistical formula that helps find variance. This formula compares a  mean value(input of user) with the values of individual diseases and gives us the variance. Then the disease that least varies with the mean data is shown as result.  This program works similar to the world-famous game "akinator" which guesses which celebrity, animal or object you have in your mind based on some questions that the user has to answer.
